Part of our drive isn't just grinding out the work, but discovering the ways we can <em>do</em> the work better. We often prioritize projects that teach us lessons or give us tools and design patterns we can reuse. We still go toe-to-toe with bigger news organizations, but we're out here trying to moneyball interactive news.</p><p>If you like working out in the open, thinking critically about news design, sharing your code as your journalism, we do, too. We're aggressively open source. Spool through our <a href="https://the-politico.github.io">repos</a> to see what we mean. Want to know how we work, you don't have to guess. <a href="https://docs.politicoapps.com">We open sourced that, too.</a></p><p>We aren't driven by clicks or awards, but we aggressively market our work and take responsibility for our own strategy. If it's unique or innovative or just feels POLITICO, we'll pursue a new approach over a dozen derivative ideas.</p><p>We're also invested in our staff's growth, both in their careers and where we can support them beyond the job. We specifically look for projects that will help the team stretch for new skills. We set professional goals regularly and give frequent feedback on them.</p></div><div><h2>Why work at POLITICO</h2><p>POLITICO’s business model is both <a href="https://digiday.com/media/revenue-politico-growing-sales-team-35-percent/">profitable and growing</a>.
