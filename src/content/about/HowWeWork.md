We work on everything from breaking news to complex projects we manage across weeks and months.

Our ideas come from close collaboration with reporters and editors as much as they do from constant conversation within our own team.

We publish content within our CMS and maintain our own platforms to publish code freely.

We are constantly refining and reinventing how we work, from the conventions we use in our code to the way we meet together. Everything on the team is in a process of becoming something better and everyone on the team is an equal partner in getting us there.

We are committed to radical transparency, whether that's broadcasting our priorities or open-sourcing our code.

We like coffee, unless we don't and drink tea. We like metal music, unless we don't. We like cats, unless we don't.
