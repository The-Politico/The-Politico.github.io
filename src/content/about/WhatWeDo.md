We are a team of journalist-developers working alongside some of the best politics and policy reporters in the country. Our job is loosely defined as broadening POLITICO's report, giving our reporters new tools, finding visual ways to break news and telling our own stories in new ways.

We run [elections](https://www.politico.com/election-results/2018/), build [newsroom tools](https://github.com/The-Politico/django-kanban-budget), tackle [live coverage](https://www.politico.com/interactives/2019/trump-state-of-the-union-2019-live-fact-check-transcript-2/5/19/), design [information graphics](https://www.politico.com/interactives/2018/trump-russia-investigation-ties/), develop [dataviz](https://www.politico.com/interactives/2019/trump-approval-rating-polls/), curate [databases](https://www.politico.com/interactives/databases/trump-white-house-visitor-logs-and-records/index.html) and craft immersive features for POLITICO's [biggest stories](https://www.politico.com/interactives/2017/obama-hezbollah-drug-trafficking-investigation/).

We actively build and rebuild our workflow and relationships in a thoughtful way. We work hard, have fun and value work-life balance.
