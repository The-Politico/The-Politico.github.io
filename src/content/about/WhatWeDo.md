We are a team of journalist-developers working alongside some of the savviest, scoopy-est politics and policy reporters in the country. Our job is loosely defined as broadening POLITICO's report, giving our reporters new tools, finding visual ways to break news and telling a few stories ourselves.

We run [elections](https://www.politico.com/election-results/2018/texas/), build [newsroom tools](https://github.com/The-Politico/django-kanban-budget), design [better displays of information](https://www.politico.com/interactives/2018/trump-russia-investigation-ties/), [develop dataviz](https://www.politico.com/interactives/2017/politico-morning-consult-poll/), curate [databases](https://www.politico.com/interactives/databases/trump-white-house-visitor-logs-and-records/index.html) and craft immersive features for POLITICO's [biggest stories](https://www.politico.com/interactives/2017/obama-hezbollah-drug-trafficking-investigation/).

We're a new team, building and rebuilding our workflow and relationships in a thoughtful way. We work hard, but we strive to make our jobs fun and maintain lives outside of work as well.
