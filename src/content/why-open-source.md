We believe that collaboration across the news industry is key to solving our common problems. That's why, when we solve a technical problem that we think others can use, we open source our work. 

What you'll find below are Yeoman generators that scaffold out the types of projects many newsrooms do, such as standalone interactive pages and reusable chart modules. You'll find Django projects that model out election data. And you'll find handy little tools that just do One Thing Well.

For any of the projects listed below, we welcome collaboration and feedback. Try them out, open issues and submit pull requests!
