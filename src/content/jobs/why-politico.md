## Why work at POLITICO

POLITICOâ€™s business model is both [profitable and growing](https://digiday.com/media/revenue-politico-growing-sales-team-35-percent/). We offer 12-week paid parental leave, a flexible vacation policy, comprehensive benefits to employees and their families, 401(k) matching, commuter subsidy and cell service reimbursement. Our Rosslyn office is home to our much vaunted [snack bar](https://www.washingtonian.com/2017/05/23/snack-controversy-rocks-politico-newsroom/) and is easily accessible from anywhere in the DMV.
