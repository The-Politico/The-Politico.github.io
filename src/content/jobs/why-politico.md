## Why work at POLITICO

POLITICO’s business model is both [profitable and growing](https://digiday.com/media/revenue-politico-growing-sales-team-35-percent/). We offer 12-week paid parental leave, a flexible vacation policy, comprehensive benefits to employees and their families, 401(k) matching, commuter subsidy and cell service reimbursement. Our Rosslyn office is home to our much vaunted [snack bar](https://www.washingtonian.com/2017/05/23/snack-controversy-rocks-politico-newsroom/) and easily accessible — just 2 blocks from the metro – from whichever part of the DMV suits your fancy.

Beyond the defined benefits, POLITICO's newsroom is vibrant, encourages experimentation and is flatly organized in a way that gives us a high level of autonomy and recognition.

As newsrooms go, it's pretty punk rock here.
