### Graphics reporter

We're hiring a graphics reporter! We’re looking for someone fluent in data visualization and information design who will add important context to news events and steer the conversation in a new direction with their original reporting.

If that’s you, you’ll help shape the voice and visual signature of the POLITICO Interactives team. POLITICO’s is a highly collaborative newsroom where you'll work closely with some of the best politics and policy reporters and editors in the industry to pitch, report and build visual stories with a sharp focus.

A typical day may find you tackling a chart on a breaking news deadline, diving into dataset for a story you're reporting that week or fine tuning a graphic component on our elections rig.

You should be well-versed in the basic techniques of modern dataviz development: basic HTML and CSS as well as JavaScript, including libraries like D3 and, at a stretch, a component library like React. Experience with geospatial tools like QGIS, data processing in Python or R and a familiarity with building graphics in Adobe Illustrator are also preferred, but not required.

More important than the technical skills you’ll need is the way you strengthen our team. We’re looking for someone who values sharpening other’s ideas as much as pitching their own. You’ll have latitude to determine a lot about the pace and structure of your work, but you’ll also be responsible for keeping in touch with the news cycle. You’ll come to the table with lots of ideas based in a keen reading of the news, and you’ll be flexible while working on an array of deadlines.

Previous experience in a newsroom is a plus but not required if you can show us you’re ambitious and capable.

 If you like asking, "What if we tried...?" get in touch.
