## Why work on Interactive News at POLITICO

If you're comfortable working with a high degree of autonomy and a wide scope of responsibility, our team is a unique opportunity.

Because we're small, we have to be radically economical, and we treat that as our advantage. Part of our drive isn't just to grind out the work, but to discover the ways we can _do_ the work better. We often prioritize projects that teach us lessons or give us tools and design patterns we can reuse. We go toe-to-toe with bigger news organizations, so if you're game, we're out here trying to moneyball interactive news.

If you like working out in the open, thinking critically about news design, sharing your process _as your journalism_, we do, too. We're aggressively open source. Spool through our [repos](https://the-politico.github.io) to see what we mean. Want to know how we work, you don't have to guess. [We open sourced that, too.](https://docs.politicoapps.com)

While we aren't driven by traffic, we **do** work hard to make our journalism accessible and meet readers where they are. If it's unique or innovative or just _feels POLITICO_, we'll say yes over the dozen derivatives to pursue a new approach.

We're also invested in our staff's growth, both in their careers and where we can support them beyond the job. We specifically look for projects that will help the team stretch for new skills. We set professional goals regularly and give regular feedback on them. We can't always offer the _quantity_ of support you'd get on a larger team, so instead we focus on the quality.
