### Why work on Interactive News at POLITICO

Small, lean teams like ours aren't necessarily for everyone. But for folks comfortable working out in front with a high degree of autonomy and a wide scope of responsibility, POLITICO's team is a unique opportunity.

Because we're small we have to be radically economical, and we treat that as our advantage. Part of our drive isn't just to grind out the work, but to discover the ways we can _do_ the work better. We often prioritize projects that teach us lessons or give us tools we can use again. We go toe-to-toe with our bigger neighbors, so if you're coming in with something to prove, we're out here trying to moneyball interactive news.

If you like working out in the open, about sharing your code and your process _as your journalism_, we are, too. We're aggressively open source. Spool through our [repos](https://the-politico.github.io) to see what we mean. Want to know how we work, you don't have to guess. [We open sourced that, too.](https://docs.politicoapps.com)

We're not chasing traffic, even if we love it when we find it. If it's unique or innovative or just _feels POLITICO_, we're only too happy saying no to a dozen derivatives you'll see on some other website.

We're also invested in our staff's growth, both in their careers and where we can support them beyond the job. We specifically look for projects that will help you stretch for new skills. We set professional goals regularly and give regular feedback on them. We can't offer the _quantity_ of support you'd get on a larger team, so instead we focus on the quality. We think that's better, anyway.
