## News applications developer

We’re looking for a skilled coder to build new platforms and tools that drive our politics and policy reporting.

In 2020, the Interactive News team will help lead our coverage of the presidential and congressional campaigns. This position is critical part of that project, laying the groundwork in 2019 for our coverage in 2020.

Our tent-pole election night pages are especially high stakes and command **huge, highly engaged audiences**. You're the type of person who appreciates that challenge and is motivated by the opportunity to lead POLITICO’s marquee on our busiest nights, working alongside the rest of the Interactive News team.

It's not all elections though. You’ll build newsapps that help automate or expand our journalists’ reporting. You’ll contribute to our large body of open source work. You’ll help build our most innovative journalism. You’ll also play a critical role in defining success on a small team with a high level of personal equity in the way we work and the priorities we set.

This position, like all others on the Interactive News team, is part of the POLITICO newsroom — **not** a product development team — and that’s how we like it. Your work will be grounded in your keen editorial judgment and close working relationships with Politico's deeply sourced reporters and editors. A background in journalism is a plus, but not required. A commitment to the editorial goals and standards of our newsroom is a must.

Because of the wide scope of this position on a small team, you will work across our entire technology stack. Our current fashion is a mixture of Python/Django and Node/Express on the backend with React/Redux on the frontend. Most of our staff come into the job not knowing _at least_ one part of the stack we use. **The ability to learn is far more valuable to our team than what you don’t know today.**

Not required, but make sure you tell us if you've:

- Covered politics, elections, campaign finance or polling
- Developed open source software
- Worked with public data
- Experience or training in applied statistical techniques
- Experience in an unrelated industry (tell us about any skills you think will transfer over)

The salary range for this position is based on previous experience and skill level. We may hire the position as a _Senior_ News Applications Developer, pending experience.

It’s a tremendous time to be working in a D.C. newsroom, and POLITICO’s is foremost among the rest. Join us!
