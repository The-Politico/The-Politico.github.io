#### News applications developer

POLITICO seeks a newsapps developer to join our Interactive News team.

We’re looking for a skilled coder to help build new platforms and tools that will help drive our politics and policy reporting.

In 2020, the Interactive News team will help lead our coverage of the presidential and congressional campaigns. We are designing this position to be a critical part of that project, laying the groundwork in 2019 for our coverage in 2020. Our tent-pole election night pages are especially high stakes and command huge, engaged audiences. You’ll be the type of person who appreciates that challenge and is motivated by the opportunity to lead POLITICO’s marquee on our busiest nights, working alongside the rest of the Interactive News team.

But there’ll be plenty of work outside campaigns, too. You’ll build newsapps that help automate or expand our journalists’ reporting. You’ll contribute to our large body of open source work. You’ll help build our most innovative journalism. You’ll also play a critical role in defining success on a small team with a high level of personal equity in the way we work and the priorities we set.

This position, like all others on the Interactive News team, is part of the POLITICO newsroom — **not** a product development team — and that’s how we like it. We want you to base your work on your keen editorial judgment and close working relationships with frontline reporters and editors. A background in journalism is obviously a plus but not required. A commitment first and foremost to the editorial goals and standards of our newsroom is non-negotiable.

Because of the wide scope of this position on a small team, you will likely work across our technology stack. Our current fashion is a mixture of Python/Django and Node/Express on the backend with React/Redux on the frontend. Most of our staff come into the job not knowing _at least_ one part of the stack we use. The ability to learn is far more valuable to our team than what you don’t know today.

It’s a tremendous time to be working in a D.C. newsroom, and POLITICO’s is foremost among the rest. Apply below and reach out to us at <mailto:interactives@politico.com>.

If you have any of these previous experiences, please be sure to let us know:

-   Covered politics, elections, campaign finance or polling
-   Developed open source software
-   Worked with public data
-   Experience or training in applied statistical techniques
-   Experience in an unrelated industry (tell us about any skills you think will transfer over)

The salary range for this position will be based on your previous experience and skill level. We may hire you in as a Senior News Applications Developer if that title and pay grade are appropriate for your background.
