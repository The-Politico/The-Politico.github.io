We believe that collaboration across the news industry is key to solving our common problems. We also believe that our code is our journalism and that obligates us to be transparent with our source whenever we can.

Open sourcing our work also has the practical advantage of inviting others to participate, which increases our capacity to do good work. It's also a critical feature of how we manage projects on our team. (Turns out imagining how strangers will use our code is a pretty good way to guess how we'll use it a few weeks down the line.)

For any of the projects listed below, we welcome collaboration and feedback. Try them out, open issues and submit pull requests.
