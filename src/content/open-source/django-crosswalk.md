### [django-crosswalk](https://github.com/The-Politico/django-crosswalk)


Django-crosswalk is an entity service that provides a few basic, but highly extensible tools to resolve entity IDs and create linked records of known aliases.

We use it to standardize IDs across datasets, to create a master crosswalk of all known aliases and as a reference library for entity metadata, augmenting libraries like [us](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/us).
