# Introducing our new team, new site and new blog


## New team


## New site

So with a new team, I've rebuilt and redesigned our team site.

## New blog

Let's take it for a spin.

##### Markdown

Everything you see here has been rendered from a markdown file using our own

##### Code

Our new blog includes handsome code snippets across the languages we regularly use on the desk.

```python
def hello_world():
  return 'Yo'
```

```javascript
const nextLevel = level => level += 1;
```
