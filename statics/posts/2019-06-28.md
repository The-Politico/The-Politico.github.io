This post is about how we made part of our [2020 Democratic primary polls tracker](https://www.politico.com/2020-election/democratic-presidential-candidates/polls/).

Our polling partner Morning Consult gives us data on likely Democratic voters‚Äô first choice among candidates for POTUS each week. That data also breaks down by around **350** different demographic factors, with an amazingly large sample size of approximately 17,000 respondents each week. The sheer numbers made for a golden field of data, so we went frolicking. üå±

### The data

The poll data covered basic demographics, like race, education, income, and age. It also intersected those groups, so we had the opinions of Democratic voters who were also:

* White and conservative (1274 of them, 44% for Biden)
* Black men from rural communities (236 of them, 51% for Biden)
* Black and ages 18 to 44 years (1710 of them,
* Protestant, Mormon, Jewish (... and several other religions)
* Apathetic, ambivalent, enthusiastic about politics
* ...and more, and more

The possibilities were endless, but chaotic. There are only so many sane ways to show 358 opinions about 23 candidates. Our first move was to cut demographic groups by about half and consider only their support for the top 10 candidates.

The problem remains - how do we compare groups of different sizes? How do we deal with the difference between Joe Biden getting the support of 39% of the 132 Muslim voters in our poll and 39% of the 1,079 white, rural women? Maybe we‚Äôre asking the wrong questions.

We already know who has the most supporters from almost any poll story - Biden leads with about 40% of Democrats, Bernie trails around 20%, and other candidates lag even further behind. We wanted to answer a different question: **How much does each candidate‚Äôs base of support look like Democratic voters overall?** That might tell us something about a candidate's appeal to different demographic groups and also how much each candidate is relying on those groups to form the base of their support.


### The charts

We have the topline Democratic voter numbers from Morning Consult, which includes the usual 70/20/10 white/black/other race breakdown among voters. Given that distribution, it‚Äôs pretty interesting that Cory Booker‚Äôs supporters are **55/40 white/black** while Pete Buttigieg has a **92/5 white/black** base. What we want to show is that black voters are **way over-represented** in Booker's base and **way under-represented** in Buttigieg's.

Some ~ exploration ~ sketches of over/under-representation:

Our final design, which we call [chatterbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_fortune_teller) charts, has a couple features that sold us:
* It shows demographic traits grouped together by a polygon - an n-gon to be exact, where n is the number of traits.
* Each trait gets its own side of the n-gon.
* We can contextualize the data with the demographics of Democratic voters overall, * represented by the dotted line.
* Every demographic group is scaled to the same area. This means groups with relatively small sample sizes can still be compared fairly across all candidates.
* The area of triangles representing positive differences in the data are linearly proportional to those representing negative differences.

What I like most about these charts is that a reader can spot **deviance** from the ‚Äúnorm‚Äù quickly. Candidates that are average Joes (pun intended) won‚Äôt have a lot of color, since their supporter demographics will reflect the same balance of race, gender, income, etc. as Democratic voters overall. This is really obvious with Joe Biden, who rarely has a chatterbox triangle fold in or out more than half way. What‚Äôs more interesting is that you can also see the extremes. Almost every candidate, for example, has around a 50/50 male/female base. Andrew Yang is the only candidate pushing those proportions, with a ratio of 65/35 male/female.

We saw the same phenomenon when surveying voter interest in politics. Joe Biden‚Äôs got a bit of everyone, while Pete Buttigieg captured the extremes, winning a larger share of voters "very" and "extremely" interested in politics than any other candidate.

If you‚Äôre interested in how I physically made these charts, HMU and we can do some geometry and trig together.
