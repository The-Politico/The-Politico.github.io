# Poll Paradise and Fortune Tellers

This post is about how we made part of our [2020 Democratic primary polls tracker](https://www.politico.com/2020-election/democratic-presidential-candidates/polls/).

Morning Consult gave us Democratic voters‚Äô first choices for POTUS, in **358** demographic groups with a sample size of approximately 17,000. The sheer numbers made for a golden field of data paradise, so we went frolicking. üå±

### The data

The poll data covered basic demographics, like race, education, income, and age. It also intersected those groups, so we had the opinions of Democratic voters who were also:

* White and conservative (1274 of them, 44% for Biden)
* Black men from rural communities (236 of them, 51% for Biden)
* Black and ages 18 to 44 years (1710 of them,
* Protestant, Mormon, Jewish (... and several other religions)
* Apathetic, ambivalent, enthusiastic about politics
* ...and more, and more

The possibilities were endless, but chaotic. There are only so many sane ways to show 358 opinions about 23 candidates. Our first move was to cut demographic groups to about half and their support for only the top 10 candidates.

The problem remains - how do we compare groups of different sizes? Is there a difference between the 39% of the 132 Muslims and 39% of 1079 white, rural women polled who preferred Joe Biden? Maybe we‚Äôre asking the wrong questions.

Our best came from thinking about the data from the **candidates‚Äô standpoint**. We already know who has the most supporters from almost any poll story - Biden leads with about 40% of Democrats, Bernie trails by about half, and other candidates trail by at least half of that. We wanted to answer a different question: **How much does each candidate‚Äôs base of support look like Democratic voters overall?**


### The charts

We have Dem. voter numbers just from looking at overall figures: the usual 70/20/10 white/black/other race breakdown, approx. 50/50 male/female, etc. Given that distribution, it‚Äôs pretty interesting that Cory Booker‚Äôs supporters are **55/40 white/black** while Pete Buttigieg has a **92/5 white/black** constituency. What we want to show is how Booker is **way over-performing** and Buttigieg is way **under-performing** with black voters.

Some ~ exploration ~ sketches of positive and negative performance:

Our final design, which we call chatterbox charts, has a couple features that sold us:
* It shows demographic traits grouped together by a polygon - an n-gon to be exact, where n is the number of traits
* Each trait gets its own side of the n-gon
* We can contextualize the data with the demographics of Democratic voters overall, * represented by the dotted line
* Every demographic group is scaled to the same area. This means groups with relatively small sample sizes can still be compared fairly across all candidates.
* The area of triangles representing positive differences in the data are linearly proportional to those representing negative differences

What I like most about these charts is that a reader can spot **deviance** from the ‚Äúnorm‚Äù quickly. Candidates that are average Joes (pun intended) won‚Äôt have a lot of color, since their supporter demographics will reflect the same balance of race, gender, income, etc. as Dem. voters overall. This is really obvious with Joe Biden, who rarely has a chatterbox triangle fold in or out more than half way. What‚Äôs more interesting is that you can also see the extremes. Almost every candidate, for example, has around a 50/50 male/female base. Andrew Yang is the only one guy pushing those proportions, with a ratio of 65/35 male/female.

Same phenomenon when surveying voter interest in politics. Joe Biden‚Äôs got a bit of everyone. Pete Buttigieg captured the extremes, winning a larger share of voters extremely and very interested in politics than any other candidate.
