### [django-slack-events-router](https://github.com/The-Politico/django-slack-events-router)

Lets you extend your use of free Slack by creating an events router to send Slack Events API messages to any number of endpoints via custom webhook routes. You can then configure filters for your custom routes based on event type or channel, giving you a powerful way to filter the Event API's firehose to just the messages your downstream apps need.
