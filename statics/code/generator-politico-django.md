### [generator-politico-django-package](https://github.com/The-Politico/generator-politico-django-package)

This is a Yeoman generator that creates a basic scaffold for a pluggable Django application.

The scaffold comes with:

- a node-based static files build system
- utilities for publishing to AWS S3
- a settings conf for pluggable apps
- pre-made structure for Django Rest Framework and Celery
- a built-in, preconfigured example project
- development environment management with [pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/)
