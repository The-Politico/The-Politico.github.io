This is the Yeoman generator that all of our standalone front-end projects are borne from. It gives you the following:

- Scaffolds your projectâ€™s development directory.
- Compiles SCSS and bundles JS written in either ES5 or ES2015 using webpack.
- Renders HTML templates with custom context.
- Creates responsive image sets optimized for mobile devices.
- Publishes your project to an Amazon S3 bucket.
