POLITICO is looking for an enterprising editor to lead a team of ambitious journalists — developers, graphics reporters and designers — working alongside the best politics and policy reporting teams in the industry. The Interactive News Desk creates [compelling](https://www.politico.com/interactives/2019/2020-democrats-spanish-translation/) [interactive](https://www.politico.com/interactives/2019/election-security-americas-voting-machines/)   [stories](https://www.politico.com/interactives/2019/joe-biden-online-fundraising-actblue/) , runs [election night results](https://www.politico.com/election-results/2018/texas/) , tracks [political campaigns](https://www.politico.com/2020-election/candidates-views-on-the-issues/michael-bennet/) , builds [new platforms](https://www.politico.com/2020-election/live-updates-and-analysis/democratic-debate-night-two-miami/?v=analysis)  for our reporting, open-source [newsroom tools](https://github.com/The-Politico/gootenberg) , design powerful presentations for [featured investigations](https://www.politico.com/interactives/2018/trump-russia-investigation-ties/)  and [much, much more](https://www.politico.com/news/interactives) .

The ideal candidate is full of original ideas for creative enterprise journalism, finds compelling narratives in datasets large and small, and is eager to lead the team's efforts as they build the fastest, most informative live election results 2020 can offer.

This person should have a strong vision for a powerful, technical team that constantly experiments in style and delivery. They will have a drive to collaborate across the newsroom — and a knack for pinpointing visual and interactive opportunities in our most important reporting verticals. They'll need sharp news judgment and a keen interest in politics, polling, elections and campaigns. The editor must have the technical skills to manage documentation of open source and internal tools, hone our strategy for securing, testing and publishing our work across AWS platforms and identify potential technical issues — often before they arise. They will be adept at working quickly under pressure to troubleshoot problems that arise in our fast-paced, breaking news environment.

What you’ll need...

- Experience managing special projects or a team of visual or computational journalists within a newsroom or other editorial setting.
- A desire to lead a team while helping the newsroom at large build its visual and data reporting skills.
- A full-stack development skill set, including fluency in one back-end language (e.g., Python, Node), front-end fundamentals (HTML, CSS & JavaScript) and a modern JavaScript framework (React, Vue, etc.). We're currently a React shop on the front-end powered by a Python/Django and Node backend.
- Comfort with basic applied quantitative and statistical principles and experience doing data cleaning and analysis in a programming language such as Python or R.
- Minimum four years experience building high quality interactive and graphic features that clearly demonstrate your instincts for storytelling on multiple platforms.
- Strong fluency with data journalism and its published output in copy, graphics and design.
- Clear record of working with non-technical journalists and senior editors to realize new storytelling forms.
- History developing, maintaining or supporting open source software, experience building cloud-based architecture and familiarity with GIS software (QGIS, ArcGIS) and analysis are all a plus, but not required.

As part of the job you will...

- Establish the vision for the team, including long term goals that facilitate smart, memorable enterprise politics coverage.
- Define and build static and interactive charts alongside the team, creating evergreen databases and trackers, specially designed stories, newsroom reporting tools, and more.
- Develop best practices and templates for interactive news that help the team move more quickly while holding to standards for accessibility, style and POLITICO’s editorial brand.
- Pitch, plan, manage and represent the journalistic goals of the team, balancing them with the needs of the wider newsroom.
- Shape a digital strategy along with key stakeholders in the newsroom.
-Prioritize tool building that enables the newsroom at large to recognize and tackle visual storytelling opportunities.
- Guide and bulletproof data journalism across the newsroom.
